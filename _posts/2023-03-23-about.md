<!-- <span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->

I’m a proud Cincinnati native, an Ohio State Buckeye, and now a data analyst on a high-performing brand marketing team that sets industry standards. 

I graduated from The Ohio State University in the spring of 2021 with a Bachelor’s degree specializing in Marketing with a minor in Psychology. On academic merit, I was directly admitted to the Fisher College of Business where I pursued a challenging academic curriculum as an Honors Student. 

Now two years post-graduation, I have been overjoyed to continue building my data analysis and marketing abilities as a Brand Analyst at The J.M. Smucker Co. I proudly support a brand family worth over a billion dollars, through brand management and data-driven insights, made up of Jif, Smucker’s, Santa Cruz Organic, Goober, Adams, and Laura Scudder Peanut Butters as well as Sahale Snacks. 

Through this experience, I have sharpened my skills in story-telling with data, brand & budget management to exceed financial goals, and delivering breakthrough marketing tactics within the CPG industry. I proficiently analyze a variety of data inputs such as point of sale, panel, retailer data, and macro trends in order to further drive the business as we focus on building brands that consumers love. Additionally, I’ve had the opportunities to build and manage a multi-million dollar budget, contribute to Jif Peanut Butter’s rapid climb back to the #1 brand in the category amidst the aftermath of a voluntary recall, and pioneer sustainability efforts to contribute toward personal and corporate goals. 

I have a firm belief that it’s my responsibility to make the world a better place, and I’m proud to work towards that goal each and every day through my career!
